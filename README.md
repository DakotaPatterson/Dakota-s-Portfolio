# Dakota-s-Portfolio
A portfolio of my best work!

## Description

This project is a portfolio of my best work and has a section on how to contact me. My motivation was to make a webpage that dislayed my work and more about me for potential employers to locate and reach out to me. This webpage allows those potential employers to look at some of my lauched projects and see if they are compatible with their standards. I have learned that making sure my work is linked to the examples is importanmt so you can be taken directly to their lauched application instead of having to search for it.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The best way to use this is to locate the links in the [header](Images/header.png) and use them to jump to the section of the page you need to go to.

Once you locate the section you need you can then read up on the needed information and use the [images and links](Images/Images.png) provided to access the lauhed applications.
